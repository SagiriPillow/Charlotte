# CharlotteRuntime
This is a standard wrapper for python applications to demonstrate Sagiri Python.
Sagiri Python is also an open source project of mine.
You only need to add its header file to the project to start calling python from C(++) language.
A simple PythonShell is preset in Charlotte Runtime.


# How can I use it?
Very simple, just put your program into the application folder and put the libraries needed by your program into the module folder.
